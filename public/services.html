                      <h3>Street Patrols</h3>

                      <p>This is not a new concept. It is a concept whereby security officers are placed on the ground, patrolling a designated either on foot or by bicycle. So ensuring visibility in the area and stamping out crime.
                        This concept was taken over from the English, where the "Bobby"(police officer) patrols the streets, gathering intelligence and being the eyes and ears of the community.</p>
                        
                        <p>The "Bobbies" are hand picked and their backgrounds scrutinized over and above the normal SIRA standards. This is to ensure trust between the community and the "Bobby", as this is an essential part of the "Bobby" in the area. The "Bobby" will foster long-term relation with the community.</p>
                        <p>
                        The areas to be patrolled will be of such a nature that the "Bobby" can easily reach any area with-in seconds after receiving a call to assist or hearing an alarm. Should there be serious problem the "Bobby" will call for help from other "Bobbies" or from the supervisor closest to him. As an additional service the client can call the control room to ask a "Bobby" to ensure his house is safe should he come home late at night.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Before moving in an area Joniki Vigilance Security Limited will liaise with the local Kenya Police to ensure good relations at all levels, as help from them is essential, as this venture will assist them in the process as well.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Again, this can't be done if there is not effective management of the staff. The same level of supervision that made us different from other security companies will continue with this project.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        We have our own alarm monitoring system, which can be used by owners that want their alarms monitored and linked to the "Bobby" for fast reaction, or we will enter into a contract with your current linked alarm monitoring agent and they will then give the signals received through to our control room.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        This and the "Bobby" being in the area on a 24-hour basis, increase the overall safety in the area.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The "Bobby" will be in constant contact with the control room. His job description will be to liaise with the community, keep contact with all workers in the area, collect intelligence in his area, and give through all the suspicious persons, vehicles or any other movement in the area.
                        All this information is logged and reports compiled for future reference and to assist in ongoing crime strategic planning for the area. This will be done with the Kenya Police and the community of the area. The "Bobby" is a cost-effective way of combating crime in any area.
